This site allows users to input values and have the site perform a mathematical operation on them.

I used MVC to separate the framework, how it would be displayed, and how it would be changed into 3 separate files. I used the express framerork.

I used Mongo to store and retrieve previous inputs and their results. Since I didn't use accounts, all previous inputs from all users is displayed

I used Jade to make the HTML a little more readable and useful.
